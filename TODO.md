# ECV Handyman Services - TODO

- [ ] **Set up Google Analytics** — Create a GA4 property at analytics.google.com, get the Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXX), and add the tracking script to index.html
- [ ] **Verify or create sitemap.xml** — Check if Netlify is auto-generating one, if not create a manual one and resubmit to Google Search Console
- [ ] **Replace hero image with a work photo** — Current image is a personal photo at a restaurant. Use a shot of Ricky on a job site to convert better
- [ ] **Add before/after labels to gallery images** — Show project transformations instead of generic labels like "Quality Craftsmanship"
- [ ] **Optimize images** — Compress and convert images to WebP format. Current images are 3-4MB each which hurts page speed and Core Web Vitals (Google ranking factor)

## SEO — Outrank Competitors

- [ ] **Add business address to site + Google Business Profile** — Even a service-area business benefits from a listed city. Add it to the contact section and structured data
- [ ] **Optimize Google Business Profile** — Add photos of completed work, respond to every review, post updates weekly. This matters most for "handyman near me" searches
- [ ] **Get more Google reviews** — Keep pushing past 200. Ask every customer. The review CTA on the site helps
- [ ] **Create individual service/location pages (long-term)** — Pages like "plumber Oak Park IL", "electrician Cicero IL" would massively boost organic traffic. This is the biggest gap vs competitors
